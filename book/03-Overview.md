## Overview

Now that you're set up, let's get an overview of React!

### What Is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

React has a few different kinds of components, but we'll start with `React.Component` subclasses:

```javascript
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />
```

We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

Here, ShoppingList is a **React component class**, or **React component type**. A component takes in parameters, called `props` (short for "properties"), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method.

The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called "JSX" which makes these structures easier to write. The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

```javascript
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
  React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
  React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
```

[See full expanded version.](babel://tutorial-expanded-version)

If you're curious, `createElement()` is described in more detail in the [API reference](/docs/react-api.html#createelement), but we won't be using it in this tutorial. Instead, we will keep using JSX.

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put *any* JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

The `ShoppingList` component above only renders built-in DOM components like `<div />` and `<li />`. But you can compose and render custom React components too. For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing `<ShoppingList />`. Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components.

### Inspecting the Starter Code

If you're going to work on the tutorial **in your browser,** open this code in a new tab: **[Starter Code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010)**. If you're going to work on the tutorial **locally,** instead open `src/index.js` in your project folder (you have already touched this file during the [setup](#setup-option-2-local-development-environment)).

This Starter Code is the base of what we're building. We've provided the CSS styling so that you only need to focus on learning React and programming the tic-tac-toe game.

By inspecting the code, you'll notice that we have three React components:

* Square
* Board
* Game

The Square component renders a single `<button>` and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we'll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.

### Passing Data Through Props

To get our feet wet, let's try passing some data from our Board component to our Square component.

We strongly recommend typing code by hand as you're working through the tutorial and not using copy/paste. This will help you develop muscle memory and a stronger understanding.

In Board's `renderSquare` method, change the code to pass a prop called `value` to the Square:

```js{3}
class Board extends React.Component {
  renderSquare(i) {
    return <Square value={i} />;
  }
}
```

Change Square's `render` method to show that value by replacing `{/* TODO */}` with `{this.props.value}`:

```js{5}
class Square extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button className="square">
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

Before:

After: You should see a number in each square in the rendered output.

![React Devtools](../images/tutorial/tictac-numbers.png)

**[View the full code at this point](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/aWWQOG?editors=0010)**

Congratulations! You've just "passed a prop" from a parent Board component to a child Square component. Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children.

### Making an Interactive Component

Let's fill the Square component with an "X" when we click it.
First, change the button tag that is returned from the Square component's `render()` function to this:

```javascript{4}
class Square extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick={function() { alert('click'); }}>
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

If you click on a Square now, you should see an alert in your browser.

>Note
>
>To save typing and avoid the [confusing behavior of `this`](https://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/), we will use the [arrow function syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) for event handlers here and further below:
>
>```javascript{4}
>class Square extends React.Component {
>  render() {
>    return (
>      <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
>        {this.props.value}
>      </button>
>    );
>  }
>}
>```
>
>Notice how with `onClick={() => alert('click')}`, we're passing *a function* as the `onClick` prop. React will only call this function after a click. Forgetting `() =>` and writing `onClick={alert('click')}` is a common mistake, and would fire the alert every time the component re-renders.

As a next step, we want the Square component to "remember" that it got clicked, and fill it with an "X" mark. To "remember" things, components use **state**.

React components can have state by setting `this.state` in their constructors. `this.state` should be considered as private to a React component that it's defined in. Let's store the current value of the Square in `this.state`, and change it when the Square is clicked.

First, we'll add a constructor to the class to initialize the state:

```javascript{2-7}
class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

>Note
>
>In [JavaScript classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), you need to always call `super` when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a `constructor` should start with a `super(props)` call.

Now we'll change the Square's `render` method to display the current state's value when clicked:

* Replace `this.props.value` with `this.state.value` inside the `<button>` tag.
* Replace the `onClick={...}` event handler with `onClick={() => this.setState({value: 'X'})}`.
* Put the `className` and `onClick` props on separate lines for better readability.

After these changes, the `<button>` tag that is returned by the Square's `render` method looks like this:

```javascript{12-13,15}
class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button
        className="square"
        onClick={() => this.setState({value: 'X'})}
      >
        {this.state.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

By calling `this.setState` from an `onClick` handler in the Square's `render` method, we tell React to re-render that Square whenever its `<button>` is clicked. After the update, the Square's `this.state.value` will be `'X'`, so we'll see the `X` on the game board. If you click on any Square, an `X` should show up.

When you call `setState` in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside of it too.

### Developer Tools

The React Devtools extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) lets you inspect a React component tree with your browser's developer tools.

<img src="../images/tutorial/devtools.png" alt="React Devtools" style="max-width: 100%">

The React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components.

After installing React DevTools, you can right-click on any element on the page, click "Inspect" to open the developer tools, and the React tabs ("⚛️ Components" and "⚛️ Profiler") will appear as the last tabs to the right. Use "⚛️ Components" to inspect the component tree.

**However, note there are a few extra steps to get it working with CodePen:**

1. Log in or register and confirm your email (required to prevent spam).
2. Click the "Fork" button.
3. Click "Change View" and then choose "Debug mode".
4. In the new tab that opens, the devtools should now have a React tab.
