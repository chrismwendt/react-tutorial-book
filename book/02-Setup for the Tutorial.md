## Setup for the Tutorial

There are two ways to complete this tutorial: you can either write the code in your browser, or you can set up a local development environment on your computer.

### Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser

This is the quickest way to get started!

First, open this **[Starter Code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010)** in a new tab. The new tab should display an empty tic-tac-toe game board and React code. We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.

You can now skip the second setup option, and go to the [Overview](#overview) section to get an overview of React.

### Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment

This is completely optional and not required for this tutorial!

This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Add these boilerplate files for a barebones React app:

```commit
barebones create-react-app
```

If you run `npm install` then `npm start` in the project folder and open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser, you should see "hello, world".

3. Add styles and initial React components for the tic-tac-toe board:

```commit
set up initial board
```

Now you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.

We recommend following [these instructions](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors/) to configure syntax highlighting for your editor.
